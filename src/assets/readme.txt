This code is a React application for managing todos. Here's a summary of its functionality:

It imports necessary dependencies including React hooks (useState and useEffect), icons for edit and delete buttons, and a Navbar component.

State variables are declared to manage the todo input, the list of todos, and a flag to toggle the display of completed todos.

The useEffect hook is used to load todos from local storage when the component mounts.

Functions are defined to handle adding, toggling completion status, editing, and deleting todos. Todos are stored in local storage using localStorage.

JSX is returned to render the UI. It includes an input field for adding todos, a checkbox to toggle the display of completed todos, and a list of todos with options to edit and delete each todo.

Icons from react-icons library are used for edit and delete buttons.

CSS classes are applied for styling and layout.

Overall, the application allows users to add, view, edit, and delete todos, and their data is persisted using local storage.
